# Roadmap

This will be a working document to track feature development goals for each milestone release.

## 0.1 Milestones

- [ ] Serialization for persistent lists of object instances: upserting object instances and syncing with detach the appropriate relation
- [ ] If output overflows, instead of gameplay prompt, page to a reasonable (configurable, default telnet window size?) output limit and append a next/previous and cursor read % prompt
- [ ] Create a `Dungeon` data type for instancing multi-level mazes with metadata and reasonably "difficult" start/end goals representing passages to the next maze floor

## 0.2 Milestones

- [ ] [MCCP2 or MCCP3 support](https://mudhalla.net/tintin/protocols/mccp/)
- [ ] Exit flags: closing and opening doors, movement obstruction

## 0.3 Milestones

- [ ] Telnet implementation overhaul
